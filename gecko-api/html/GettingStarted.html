    <span> <h2>What is Crypto Currency? </h2><button class="toggle-btn">+</button> </span>

 <p> Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank or government. Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, which is a decentralized ledger that records all transactions made using the cryptocurrency.
</p>
    Cryptocurrencies are typically created through a process called mining, which involves using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical equations to validate and record transactions on the blockchain. Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.
<p>
    One of the main features of cryptocurrency is its decentralized nature, which means that it is not controlled by any central authority or government. This allows for more secure transactions and greater privacy for users. Additionally, cryptocurrencies can be used for a variety of purposes, including online purchases, investment, and international money transfers. However, their value can be highly volatile, and their use is not yet widely accepted in many countries.
 </p>

<h2>How does cryptocurrency work?</h2><button class="toggle-btn">+</button>
<div class ="toggle-paragraph">
<p>Cryptocurrency works through a decentralized ledger technology called blockchain. When someone sends cryptocurrency to another person, the transaction is recorded on a public ledger, which is the blockchain.
</p>
    Each transaction is verified and validated by a network of computers, called nodes, that are connected to the blockchain. These nodes use complex algorithms to confirm that the transaction is legitimate and that the sender has enough funds to make the transaction.
<p>
    Once a transaction is confirmed, it is added to the blockchain and cannot be altered or deleted. This provides a secure and transparent way to store and transfer value.
</p>
    Cryptocurrency also relies on encryption techniques to ensure the security of transactions and to protect the privacy of users. Transactions are signed with a private key, which is a long string of characters that only the owner of the cryptocurrency has access to.
<p>
    Overall, cryptocurrency provides a decentralized, secure, and transparent way to store and transfer value without the need for a central authority or intermediary, such as a bank.
</p>
</div>
<h2>What is Block Chain Technology?</h2> <button class ="toggle-btn">+</button>
<div class ="toggle-paragraph">
<p>Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent way. It is a network of computers that work together to maintain a shared database, with each computer in the network having a copy of the ledger.
<p>
    Whenever a new transaction is made, it is added to the blockchain as a new block. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been verified and validated by a network of nodes, using complex algorithms.
</p>
    Once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, providing a tamper-proof and transparent record of all transactions. This makes blockchain technology ideal for applications such as cryptocurrency, where transparency and security are paramount.
<p>
    Blockchain technology has many potential uses beyond cryptocurrency, including supply chain management, digital identity verification, and voting systems. It has the potential to transform industries by providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized way to store and transfer data.</p>

   </p>
   2: Digital: Cryptocurrency exists only in a digital form, and transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger called the blockchain. Traditional currencies can exist in both digital and physical forms.
<p>
    3: Limited supply: Many cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have a limited supply, which is determined by the underlying algorithm. Traditional currencies, on the other hand, can be printed by central banks as needed.
</p>
    4: Privacy: Cryptocurrency transactions are generally more private than traditional currency transactions. While traditional currency transactions can be traced, cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on the blockchain using anonymous addresses, which can make it more difficult to link a transaction to a specific person or entity.
<p>
    5: Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices can be highly volatile, with values fluctuating rapidly and unpredictably. Traditional currencies, while subject to fluctuations in exchange rates, are generally more stable in value.
</p>
<p>
    6: Overall, cryptocurrency represents a new and innovative form of currency that operates independently of traditional banking systems and government control. While it has its own unique characteristics and challenges, it has the potential to transform the way we think about and use money.

<h2>What is cryptocurrency mining and how does it work?</h2>    <button class ="toggle-btn">+</button>
<div class ="toggle-paragraph">
<p>
Mining is the process by which new cryptocurrency tokens are created and transactions are verified on a blockchain network. In essence, mining involves using powerful computer hardware to solve complex mathematical algorithms and add new transactions to the blockchain ledger.
</p>
Here's how the mining process typically works:
<p>
Nodes on the network validate new transactions and add them to a "block".

Miners compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle by using their computer's processing power to generate a unique "hash" value for the block.

The first miner to solve the puzzle and generate a valid hash adds the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with a set amount of cryptocurrency tokens.

Other nodes on the network then validate the newly added block and its transactions, and the process begins again with a new block.
</p>
<p>
The mining process is an essential component of many cryptocurrencies, as it helps to ensure the security and integrity of the blockchain network. Because miners must invest significant amounts of computing power to solve the complex puzzles, it also helps to prevent fraudulent activity and malicious attacks on the network.
</p>
<p>
However, mining can be a complex and energy-intensive process that requires specialized hardware and a significant amount of electricity. As a result, some cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, are transitioning to a "proof-of-stake" model that uses less energy and requires less computing power to validate transactions.
