However, it has since become more popular as a stand-alone blockchain, with its own native projects and decentralized applications. Major DeFi protocols such as Aave and Curve have also found second homes on Polygon. Unlike Ethereum, Polygon operates on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in which network participants can stake the network’s native MATIC tokens to validate transactions and participate in voting and other governance decisions. Polygon also hosts its own bridge that allows users to transfer assets from Ethereum to Polygon and vice versa.",

One of its biggest features is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which is spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research. The first use case for DeFi applications on Solana is Serum, built by the team behind FTX.",
